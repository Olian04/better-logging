  "description": "Javascript comes by default with 5 different standardised logging types. But as it stands only browsers are taking advantage of these different methods of logging. `better-logging` aims to improve the default logging experiance and is designed to be a drop in replacement for the default logging methods. <br>\r Since `better-logging` only decorates the default logging methods you won't lose any integrated functionality in browsers or other tooling. `better-logging` is not meant to be the be all and end all of node.js logging. It is just supposed to increase the usefullness of the default logging methods.",
